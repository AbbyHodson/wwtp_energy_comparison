Purpose: The purpose of this notebook is to assess the accuracy of different methods for estimating wastewater treatment plant energy consumption and recovery. Methods for estimating electricity consumption, energy consumption, and electricity generation from biogas utilization are applied herein to an inventory of U.S. wastewater treatment plants derived from the U.S. EPA's Clean Watersheds Needs Survey (CWNS). Using reported energy consumption/recovery values for select U.S. cities published in the 2018 study "[The State of U.S. Urban Water: Data and the Energy-Water Nexus,](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/2017WR022265)" the error associated with each of the estimation methods is calculated and visualized using kernel density estimation (KDE) plots. Error is also evaluated based on facility characteristics such as size, effluent treatment level (ETL), and latitude.
