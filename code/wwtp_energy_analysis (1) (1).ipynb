Methods for estimating electricity consumption, energy consumption, and electricity generation from digester biogas utilization are herein applied to an inventory of U.S. wastewater treatment plants derived from the U.S. EPA's Clean Watersheds Needs Survey (CWNS). Using reported energy consumption/recovery values for select U.S. cities published in the 2018 study \"[The State of U.S. Urban Water: Data and the Energy-Water Nexus](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/2017WR022265)\", the error associated with each of the estimation methods is calculated and visualized using kernel density estimation (KDE) plots. Error is also evaluated based on facility characteristics such as plant size, effluent treatment level (ETL), and latitude.\n","\n","Data Sources:\n","*   Clean Watersheds Needs Survey (CWNS) (U.S.

The intensities for electricity consumption, total energy consumption (which includes natural gas use), and, when relevant, electricity production from biogas, for each WWTP were assigned based on the most closely represented treatment train(s), assuming best practice configurations. When multiple treatment trains were equally well-matched, the intensities for all identified treatment trains were averaged.
